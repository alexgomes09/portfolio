Note : I had some different plan for this game but since I was busy with midterm and other projects.
I didn't get enough time to work on it.

Things I was planning to work on

1. rotate bird frames while bird flys opposite direction
2. make the grass animate (create some wind effect)
3. Add few different type of birds so that player accidently kill different birds. and it would make
	dramatic change on reputation or some negative score;
