            <div id="story">Not every hunting trip into the deer woods ends with a deer,
                but hunters always come home with a new story. Because stories are everywhere in the wild.
                Some are short, others are epic. It was the first week of July, 2014. It’s a beautiful sunny weather.
                Flowers’ blooming on his yard. Kachamoto is ready with his Browning Semi-Auto Grade Rifle.
                He takes so much care of this long range rifle. As this was the only rifle he has which was licensed under his dad’s name.
                Kachamoto took his car and headed northeastern Ontario, place known as Georgian Bay. Great place for hunting deer.
                At the time he reached the spot he noticed a deer. He set his rifle, crawled and took better position. He took first shot.
                Alas, it is missed. Deer noticed and started running. Kachamoto loaded the rifle again and took his second shot.
                All of a sudden it’s all silent. Kachamoto stood up and went to pick that deer.
                By the time he reached to the point he found no deer but a dead duck. He realized then he actually hunted a duck not a deer.
                While deer was running he also missed the second shot and it killed a duck.
                Now that kachamoto is on spot and all other duck’s realized their one and only child was killed.
                They are now coming to take revenge.
                Now you were magically teleported on that spot and your job is to save Kachamoto by shooting incoming ducks.
